# MagaToken

## Why?


MagaToken’s purpose is not to promote racial injustice nor racial inequality. As human beings we all have the right to be free from such. Instead, with the subtle use of satire, MagaToken is a reflection of an intolerant society that has intensified in the United States of America. Arguably that intolerance was re-branded approximately four years ago in 2016. Subsequently we have become a divided nation, with divisions extending beyond racism. The irony is that “Making America Great Again” has actually made America spiteful, belligerent and ignominious to the world.

 

## Why is this a token?


Cryptocurrencies are proof that decentralization can bring pecuniary freedom to anyone by eliminating government intervention or control. By using a cryptocurrency, in this case the Ethereum blockchain, MagaToken cannot be censored nor shutdown by tyranny. Anyone will be able to own MagaToken and contravene the unfortunate status quo. From using a digital currency’s blockchain MagaToken does possess an intrinsic value. The max supply of MagaToken is only 2020 tokens, so by owning one MagaToken you will be one of only two thousand and twenty others worldwide. It must be stated that the creators of MagaToken believed it to be an impregnable avenue for freedom of speech and do not imply any monetary value as is.

**The goal for MagaToken is to blatantly remind all of us that intolerance breeds hate, but unity perpetuates freedom.**
